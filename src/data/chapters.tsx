        It was the most ordinary spring day. I was sitting in the park playing
        my favorite mobile arcade game. The week of the same and boring quests
        was ending; all I needed was a little time to gather resources. <br />
        <br />
        Well, not just &quot;a little&quot;... 2 more hours. All for the sake of
        exploring a new location with top equipment, the best one available at
        my level. Damn, I was just waiting for this.
        <br />
        <br />
        — Wow!
        <br />
        — What is this?
        <br />
        — Mom, look at these things in the sky!
        <br />
        <br />
        What is the reason they are all yelling about? My phone almost died. Oh
        well, damn! I shift my gaze from the phone screen to the city, and… What
        the hell is this?
